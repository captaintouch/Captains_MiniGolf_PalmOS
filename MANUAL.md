## System Requirements
Any Palm OS device running OS 3.5 or higher is supported in both color and grayscale modes.
Hi-res support is available for Palm OS 5.
## Installation
If you are running OS 5 on a hires device, you need to install **MiniGolf_hires.prc**, all other devices need **MiniGolf_lowres.prc**

In addition you also need to install **MathLib.prc** and the levelpack **MiniGolf_Core_Levels.pdb**

All of these files are provided in the zip file for each release.
## How to play
From the start menu, tap 'New Game' to start a new game. 
Each level gives you 5 attempts to get the ball into the hole. (You can also select 'Practice' instead which will remove the 5 ball limit)
You aim by dragging the pen around the playing field, the further away you drag the pen, the more powerful your stroke will be. (Power is indicated by the power meter on the right).
## Level Creation
### Create a new levelpack
From the start menu, tap the 'Create Level' option.
Instead of selecting an existing level pack, select the 'New' button on the bottom and give your level pack a name.
### Start creating a new level
There are two ways to create a new level:
#### - From the start menu
From the start menu, tap the 'Create Level' option.
Select the level pack to add the new level to and choose 'Start'.
#### - In-Game
To create a new level from inside the game, start a new game (preferably in practice mode) and tap either the header or the menu icon.
From the menu, select Level Editor > Create a new level 
### Level creation tools
Once in the level editor, you can add walls and other objects into the playing field. When moving a wall start or endpoint, it will 'snap' onto other wall's start and endpoint when you get close to it. 
Make sure the outer walls form a closed line, this is needed to ensure the background and main playing field get assigned to correct colors.
#### - Adding a new item
Tap either the header or the menu icon.
From the menu, select Level Editor > Add item
#### - Deleting an item
Select the wall or other item you want to delete. Once it's highlighted, tap either the header or the menu icon.
From the menu, select Level Editor > Delete item
### Saving the level you created
To save a level, all you need to do is exit out of the editor.
Tap either the header or the menu icon.
From the menu, select Level Editor > Start / Stop editing.
This will show you a confirmation dialog asking you to save the level.
### Edit an existing level
Start a new game, preferably in practice mode and open the menu by either tapping the header or the menu icon.
From the menu, select Level Editor > Start / Stop editing
### Sharing or deleting a levelpack
A levelpack cannot (yet) be deleted directly from the application.
Instead, open a Palm OS file manager such as FileZ to locate and share or delete the corresponding database. It will be named in this format:
MiniGolf 'Name of your level pack'
